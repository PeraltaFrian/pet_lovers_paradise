Pet Lovers' Paradise Website:

Phase 2:

In this phase of the project, the task was to build a responsive navigation component and implement routing to enhance the user experience with smooth and intuitive page transitions. Tailwind CSS was used to quickly create a responsive, mobile-friendly navigation design that adapts well to different screen sizes. The navigation bar provides easy access to key sections of the application, such as the home page, services, about, contacts, sign-in, sign-up, and user profile. A burger menu was implemented for smaller devices to improve usability and ensure that navigation remains clean and accessible on compact screens. To maintain consistency across the application, buttons, cards, and forms were modularized into reusable components, ensuring uniform styling and improving maintainability.

Routing between different pages was implemented efficiently. Route guards are used to secure restricted pages such as the user dashboard, profile, and pet adoption sections. If an unauthorized user attempts to access any of these restricted areas, they are automatically redirected to the login page. This approach ensures that restricted data remain protected, creating a more secure user experience. Dynamic routing was also integrated to display individual pet profiles based on their unique identifiers. For example, routes like /pet/:id allow the application to dynamically render pet details, enabling a more personalized experience for the user.

Several challenges were encountered during this phase. Adjusting the layout for different screen sizes was initially tricky, as some elements would break or misalign on smaller screens. Implementing the burger menu required careful handling of state to ensure smooth opening and closing. Managing redirects based on user authentication required precise state handling to prevent infinite loops and broken navigation. Configuring dynamic routing to ensure the correct data was displayed upon route changes also required proper validation. Despite these challenges, this phase significantly improved the application's usability, security, and overall user experience by making it more responsive, intuitive, and dynamic.

Additional Functionality:
1. The navigation bar was enhanced to display horizontally on desktop devices and use a burger menu on smaller devices. Icons were also added to improve readability and user experience.
2. The contact page was enhanced by adding a dropdown list for "Reason for Contact" and auto-populating the user's name and email if the user is logged in, making the form more user-friendly.
3. Input validations were implemented for fields such as email address, phone number, and message length, along with error prompts to guide users when their input is invalid.
4. A new page was introduced for submitting adoption requests, enabling users to apply for adoption.

Other Features Added:
1. The routing configuration was enhanced to improve navigation and page transitions.
2. Dynamic routing was added for the pet adoption request page, enabling users access pet details and submit adoption requests for specific pets.
3. Route guards were implemented to redirect users to the login page when they attempt to access protected pages.
4. Protected routes were defined to ensure that only authenticated users can access restricted sections of the application.

Testing Instructions for Phase 2:
1. Verify that the navigation bar is responsive and adjusts properly across different screen sizes.
2. Confirm that routes are accessible through the navigation bar and lead to the correct pages.
3. Confirm that the email address and user ID are auto-populated on the contact and adoption request pages if the user is logged in.
4. Test that the input validation works correctly, and ensure error prompts appear when users enter invalid data.
5. Test dynamic routes by navigating to a specific pet's details and adoption request page, ensuring the data displays correctly.
6. Test route guards by logging out and attempting to access protected pages, ensuring the user is redirected to the login page if they are not authenticated.
7. Confirm that the application redirects unauthenticated users to the login page when attempting to access protected pages.

Phase 1:

Developing the Pet Lovers' Paradise website was an exciting journey that involved both challenges and valuable learning experiences. Our primary goal was to create a platform where pet lovers could easily adopt pets and access services like grooming, veterinary care, and caregiving, all while ensuring a user-friendly design and seamless user registration and sign-in authentication.

We chose Clerk for authentication, which simplified the implementation of secure sign-ups, sign-ins, and profile updates. We used Next.js for its performance and Tailwind CSS for its ability to create responsive, customizable designs. Initially, we faced challenges integrating the Clerk, particularly in determining the best way to use it for user registration and ensuring proper routing to protected pages. Through this process, we learned that in addition to email and password fields, we could also add first and last name fields to the registration process. This allowed us to display the userâ€™s name in our welcome phrase. We also learned how to set up middleware to handle protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users could access restricted pages. During this process, we encountered issues like 404 errors (Page Not Found) and routing issues but worked through them to ensure proper access control.

We also prioritized making the website responsive across devices, using Tailwind CSS to ensure that it looked great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Throughout development, the main challenges we encountered were integrating third-party tools and troubleshooting authentication issues. Additionally, we prepared the "Book Now" and "Submit" buttons for future functionality, though they are not a priority at this stage. Through continuous testing and refinement, we overcame these obstacles and ensured the site functioned smoothly.

Once the website was built, we conducted thorough testing to evaluate functionality, responsiveness, and user experience. Based on the test results we made adjustments to further improve both design and functionality.
